# The Arduino Club

This repository holds all the source code that we have created for our projects.

Each project has been designated a folder so that for those which encompass multiple parts, we can group the code together.

Write ups for the projects (and an overview of the club) can be found [**here**](https://joeiddon.github.io/club).
